# AdventureWorks
Data Analytics project comparing **Internet vs Store Customers** using **Python**, **AWS-Redshift** and **Power BI**.

Excited to share my recent Data Engineer project as part of my journey from Software Developer ‚Üí Data Engineer!

I analyzed the Adventure Works dataset to compare Internet Customers vs Store Customers. The Data is presented in the Excel format, I remove Data Discrepencies via Python. Placed the clean code on **S3** and then copy the code in **AWS Redhshift** for quering and mining the un tikd data stories. I created **Data Pipeline** for the new data, as the new data entered in the excel file the code clean the faulty data and then using the "Upsert" statement the new data merges into the AWS Redhsift to be displayed on the Dashboard. The brief descriptiob of the tolls are described as below: 
    
üêç Python for data cleaning
‚òÅÔ∏è AWS S3 & Redshift for storage and querying
üìä Power BI for visualization and insights

This project enhanced my skills in ETL, SQL, and data storytelling ‚Äî bridging my coding experience with analytical insights.
